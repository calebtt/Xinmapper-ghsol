/*
Further design considerations would include
interpreting an ActionString,
and to allow mapping with the MapString.
Which would mean updating ActionDescriptors to include the new
tokens, and updating this class to interpret an ActionString,
and finally update GamepadUser.

More importantly a better measure of sensitivity should
be used rather than an arbitrary value.  One may get the
impression Microsoft hath done the same and used a "slider"
for their sensitivity to hide this fact.

Finally, the ability to modify the sensitivity function
is of utmost importance, which may require a math expression
parser.  The class currently uses the graph of [ y = (x^2) / SENSITIVITY ]
which is a parabola with the quality that at the curve's highest points
it is the nearly (or exactly) the size of the viewing window--the SENSITIVITY.
Also need sensitivity for both X and Y axis.

/*
* 10/18/21
TODO add an option that lowers the deadzone for the perpindicular axis when the current axis
is above a certain percentage of usage, this should give more granular control when
one axis is moving at a high rate of speed.
